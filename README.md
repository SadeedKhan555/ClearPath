This project is a runway incursion project for a senior design group at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
The following is the baseline idea that has been provided to our group:
  My proposed project was to use the simulator that we have in LB 131, and use that as a simulated plane that navigate through the runway and taxiway, and try to simulate potential runway (or taxiway) incursion.  So the main objective is to include the simulator, which runs an XPlane.
